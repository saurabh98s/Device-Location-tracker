# Android App

This is an Android app that resides with each asset to be tracked.

## Usage
Once configured, this app keeps its location synced with Firebase, and reports
on other metrics, such as battery life.

To authenticate to Firebase, add Firebase to your Android project as described
in the 
[Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup).
